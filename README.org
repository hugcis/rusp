* Rusp: a lisp written in Rust

This is a side-project. I wrote a minimal Lisp in Rust. It still need a number
of new features to be remotely close to a working programming language.

Parsing is done with the [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom) parser framework.

** Implemented

*** Operations

- ☑️ Addition
#+begin_src sh :dir ./target/debug :export both
./rslisp -e "(+ 3 1)"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 4

- ☑ Substraction
#+begin_src sh :dir ./target/debug :export both
./rslisp -e "(- 3 1)"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 2

- ☑ Multiplication
#+begin_src sh :dir ./target/debug :export both
./rslisp -e "(* 3 12)"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 36

- ☑ Division
#+begin_src sh :dir ./target/debug :export both
./rslisp -e "(/ 3. 12)"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0.25

*** Built-ins

- [x] Define function
- [x] Eval function
- [x] Quoted expressions

**** Functions

- [x] Nth element of a list
- [x] car: first element of a list
